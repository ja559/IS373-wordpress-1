On how to connect to Git and to branch the the files \
First \
Open a new Phpstorm document \
Then go to the top menu and click on VCS \
Then go to the second line and click on "Enable Version Control Integration". \
This will open up a new window that says "Select a version control system to associate with the project root" \
Choose Git and press OK \
This will create a git repository for the current project. \
At this point you can start creating pages and documents in the file\
Once a document is created one goes to the git website and creates a new repository \
once this new repository is created  you will have a page that has the website the repository is on, copy the line and go back to PhpStorm \
At this point go to VCS at the top and click on commit. This will open up the commit window.\
Check the boxes the need to be uploaded to git and  the type in a commit message and then press commit. \
Next you press VCS again and then go down to the Git sub menu and in that submenu go down to the 5th from the bottom and look from Push \
This will bring up the push menu, and you will say Origin-define remote. click on the the define remote and a new menu will pop up. \
there will be two lines on this menu first is name and second will be url. this url line is where you paste the link that we copied earlier. \
now select the commit that we did and press push. Now go to git and check on the information that we just uploaded. \
now comes the fun part of connecting to another person. \
now go to git and go to the top menu and click on settings. once in settings go to the left menu and click on collaberators. \
Now it will require you to reconfirm your password. now it will open a new window with a search bar. enter your partners name on git or his/her email. \
once entered it will send them an email and they need to accept it.
Now that your partner has access to the repository we need to create a branch so we dont have issues working on the project at the same time.\
So go back to PhpStorm and go to the bottom right of your window and look for something that says git:master. \
click on it and go to the top of the menu and click on new branch. this new branch can be named anything but make sure that the checkout box is checked. this will make the stuff you do now all in the new branch and this way you won't step on each others toes.
now change something, commit and push again, and now both you and your partner can see what you did.
